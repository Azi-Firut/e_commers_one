You should allow 7 weeks from the mailing date of the Form W-7, for the IRS to notify you of your ITIN application status (9 to 11 weeks if you submit the application during peak processing periods (January 15 through April 30) or if you’re filing from overseas).\n\nSpouses and dependents residing outside of the U.S. cannot renew in advance. They may renew their ITIN only when filing an individual tax return, or someone else files an individual income tax return claiming them for an allowable tax benefit (such as a dependent parent who qualifies the primary taxpayer to claim head of household filing status). In these instances, they must attach a federal income tax return to their W-7 renewal application.",
